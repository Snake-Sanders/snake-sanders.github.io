# Transferring files

The new computers are comming with no USB2 nor SD card readers, therefore to send files from one PC to the other I use NetCat.
Disclaimer, NetCat (NC) is not a secure tool, to be used in closed networks, in other words, at home. Use any other tools of the kind of transferring sensitive data.

On the receiver host MACOS

    nc -l 22222 > my_file.zip

where `-l` is listen port, `my_file.zip` is the name of the file to be received.    

On the sender host Linux

    nc -w3 192.168.1.200 22222 < my_file.zip

where `-w3` is 3 seconds timeout, followed by the receiver's IP and port. `my_file.zip` is the name of the file to be transmitted.    

# Homebrew

https://brew.sh/

On MACOS install with

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

This will also install the `Command Line tools XCode`

Run these two commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:

    echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/$USER/.zprofile
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"

# Git

    brew install git

Since we are here let's configure it.

As reminder in case you enter in VI editor: 
- press `i` for insert mode (edit) 
- press `escape` then `:q!` to exit without saving.
- press `escape` then `:wq!` to exit saving.

to switch to vscode just add the following:

    git config --global e

This will create a config file `/Users/$USER/.gitconfig`    

Insert the following lines

    [core]
    editor = code --wait

now you can open it again to edit it with vscode

    git config --global e

and add the rest of your settings

```ini
[user]
    name = Nane Family
    email = email@gmail.com

[core]
    editor = code --wait

[diff]
    tool = vscode

[difftool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait --diff $LOCAL $REMOTE

[merge]
    tool = vscode

[mergetool "vscode"]
    cmd = code --wait $MERGED

[alias]
    st = status
```


# Visual Studio Code

Download VSCode, to install it just move it to the applications folder.

Add VSCode to the commnad line

1. open VSCode
2. press: cmd + shift + P
3. select: `Shell Command: Install code in PATH`

now it can be launched from the terminal using `code`

# Oh My ZSH

In order to instal `OMZ`, `ZSH` has to be the default terminal.
A good stating page is this page:

https://www.sitepoint.com/zsh-tips-tricks/

## Chose a terminal 

After MACOS Catalina `ZSH` is set as the default terminal, before used to be `Bash`.

If not, set it as default:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

You can always revert back to `Bash` using: `chsh -s $(which bash)`

## Install OMZ 

https://gabrieltanner.org/blog/customizing-terminal-using-ohmyzsh/

Provides an enhancement to the terminal with many plugins.

    sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

Note: Git is required by OMZ, by now Git should be installed.

### Set OMZ theme

There are many features to configure in OMZ but here we are going to setup the most important.

The configuration is set in `~/.zshrc`

    ZSH_THEME="agnosterSnake"
    plugins=(zsh-autosuggestions)    
    prompt_context() {prompt_segment blue default "üê∏" }
    alias ll="ls -l"
    alias lla="ls -la"

Note: the theme is `Agnoster` but here I am using an adapter version `agnosterSnake` which I will later explain why I needed.

Setting the coolest theme `Agnoster` requires a font to render the promt arrows and Git status.

https://github.com/powerline/fonts#installation

1. clone

    `git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1`

2. install

    `cd fonts`
    `./install.sh`

3. clean-up a bit

    `cd ..`
    `rm -rf fonts`

4. test it

Paste the following command on the console, it should show special symbols:

    echo "\ue0b0 \u00b1 \ue0a0 \u27a6 \u2718 \u26a1 \u2699"

![](special_symbols.png)

If this set of characters only work in VSCode but not in the external terminal then the issue is in the font, change it 

    git clone https://github.com/abertsch/Menlo-for-Powerline.git
    cd Menlo-for-Powerline
    cp "Menlo for Powerline.ttf" ~/.fonts

Then in Terminal change in settings the font to `Go Mono for Powerline`

### Custom promt

In the configuration `~/.zshrc` I used the different theme `ZSH_THEME="agnosterSnake"`
Here I am using my version of the theme, I called `agnosterSnake` to fix a color contrast issue on MACOS. I just duplicated the `agnoster` theme file which is located in  `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`. This I assume it could be fixed by changing the Theme but I was having some issues.

Here is the change

_~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/agnosterSnake.zsh-theme_
```bash
    # Dir: current working directory
    prompt_dir() {
    # Original settings:
    # prompt_segment blue $CURRENT_FG ' %~ '

    # Altered settings:
    # added white as foreground color to avoid low contrast to dark blue in MacOs
    # added a limit of 25 chars when the directory path is too long 
    prompt_segment blue white ' %25<...<%~%<< '
    }
````

After the Terminal is configured, check for any configuration you had added to the `~/.bash_profile`, it can be the case that other programs are installed and configured in this file such as path or settings, these settings should be moved to `~/.zshrc`

# Asdf

    https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html#_2-download-asdf

download with 

    brew install asdf

Add asdf.sh to your ~/.zshrc with:

    echo -e "\n. $(brew --prefix asdf)/libexec/asdf.sh" >> ${ZDOTDIR:-~}/.zshrc

# Terminal 

Here is a set of colors I like for the terminal 

![](./iterm_colors.png)

The settings can be imported using the file [sublime.terminal](sublime.terminal)

to import it, go to `Terminal/preferences/profile` and below the list of themes there is button "...", in there select `import` and open `sublime.terminal` file. 

In order to keep GIT branch icons working the font must be set to `Go Mono for Powerline 18`.
